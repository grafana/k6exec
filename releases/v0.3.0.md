k6exec `v0.3.0` is here ðŸŽ‰!

## Embedded k6 PoC removed

The `embedded k6 PoC` introduced in v0.3.0 does not allow `k6exec` to be installed using the regular `go install` command. Since we want to keep the `go install` installation method, the `embedded k6 PoC` has been removed.

**Description from the v0.2.0 release notes:**

> *Default k6 executable has been embedded*
> 
> *For a better user experience, the default k6 executable has been embedded in `k6exec`. If the user does not use any extensions and does not specify any version constraints for k6, the embedded default k6 executable will be executed. This results in much faster execution in a significant number of cases.*
