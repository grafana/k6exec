k6exec `v0.2.0` is here ðŸŽ‰!

## Default k6 executable has been embedded

For a better user experience, the default k6 executable has been embedded in `k6exec`. If the user does not use any extensions and does not specify any version constraints for k6, the embedded default k6 executable will be executed. This results in much faster execution in a significant number of cases.

## Dependency updates

- grafana/k6deps updated to v0.2.0
- k6 provisioning logic extracted to grafana/k6provision v0.1.0
