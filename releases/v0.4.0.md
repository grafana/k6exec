k6exec `v0.4.0` is here ðŸŽ‰!

## k6exec now uses k6provider

`k6exec` now uses [k6provider](https://github.com/grafana/k6provider) to get the `k6` binary with the required extensions.

`k6provider` offers configuration options via environment variables that are honored by `k6exec`.
- `K6_BUILD_SERVICE_AUTH`: authentication token to access the build service.
- `K6_DOWNLOAD_AUTH`: authentication token used to download binaries.


### Breaking changes

`k6provider` library only supports getting binaries from a [k6build](https://github.com/grafana/k6build) service. Running a local build is not longer supported.

Therefore providing a the URL to this service is required. It can be provided using either the `K6_BUILD_SERVICE_URL` environment variable or the `--build-service-url` CLI option.

### Known issues

- The binary is no longer automatically cleanup after execution  [k6exec#91](https://github.com/grafana/k6exec/issues/91)
- Concurrent executions sharing can fail due to a conflict downloading the binary [k6provider#43](https://github.com/grafana/k6provider/issues/43)

## k6exec supports k6 cloud command

`k6exec` now supports running the [k6 cloud](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/testing/k6/author-run/use-the-cli/#run-a-test-on-grafana-cloud-k6) command.
